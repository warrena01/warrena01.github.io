												<h3>Discussion</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Twitter, and social media more widely, is an ever-increasing site for volunteered geographic 
												information. Such platforms centre around a user profile, which includes user-defined spatial 
												locators, most commonly ‘where the user lives’. Whilst this is not a real-time locator for the 
												user’s ever-changing location through geographic space that remains true despite such 
												movements (Field and O’Brien, 2010), it can be used as a proxy for the location of the user 
												content (Huck et al., 2015). However, geocoding using this data provides two interconnecting 
												issues: (1) spatial ambiguity arises in the scalar and spatial extent to which a user defines the 
												place they are from, which hinders upon place-based attachments and importance for varying 
												place-identities; (2) representing place from these definitions occurs as a representive point 
												within the administrative area attributed to this place (which is rarely the true user location 
												within this region, or even may not be the correct region itself, given place’s subjective spatial 
												extension). Resulting from this, is ‘false hotspots’, given the georeferenced data reduces 
												spatially variable data to the same singular coordinate location, therefore, often 
												misrepresenting the true area, location, or nature of the place intended by the user (Jones et 
												al., 2008; Rahimi et al., 2003). 
											</p>
											<p>
												As is evident in the data used for this project, the random 1023 sample of 
												passively geocoded level 3 tweets are represented at a greatly reduced number of locations. 
												As shown above, the entire tweet data set, and places to which they ‘originate’, is reduced 
												to a series of singular points in geographic space, which are spatially ambiguous given each 
												point at the same place is represented identically but each point refers to different, subjective 
												arrangements and understandings of the defined place. Hence, creating a representation of 
												numerous false hotspots. Perhaps the most pertinent example of this for this dataset, is a 
												singular point representation for Manchester, which could have been referenced by a user at 
												a variety of scales (e.g. Greater Manchester, Manchester borough, Manchester at a city-scale). Importantly, as Silvan et al. (2009) have spoken to, the relationship between how 
												misleading such spatial ambiguities can be in representations is premised upon the closeness 
												between the spatial scale at which the place was observed, and the scale at which it is 
												represented. Meaning, false hotspots for this project (at a borough scale and represented at 
												a Greater Manchester spatial scale) should be considered to greatly alter the map as 
												interpretable as a true reflection of the spatial patterns. 
											</p>
											<p>
												Given such problematic ‘raw’ data and its resulting representations, using weighted redistribution offers 
												a method to redistribute points from their currently geolocated points, to new locations that are more 
												likely to reflect the patterns in the entire dataset. This isn’t to say the redistributed output is more or less 
												true than the original data, but that it is likely to be more representative of the actual, unknown, patterns present. 
												Weighted redistribution does this, by individually relocating each data point to one of a set of ‘w’ random1
												coordinates, and the new location for each point being assigned based upon the highest valued random 
												coordinate from a weighted raster surface (that is believed to hold similar patterns to that Twitter activity 
												would, making them comparable and useful in defining likely patterns for the Twitter data). ‘w’ is value 
												relational to the weighted surface, given increased random points improves the likelihood of a high 
												scoring cell, making the new pattern more likely to reflect the weighted surfaces’. Each new location is 
												represented as a distribution around the new coordinates, so not to simply reproduce a new false 
												hotspot, as the ‘true’ location of the data is unknown and given the projects intention to identify an area 
												within which the data point was likely to be located, not where it actually is. This project used a 
												population density raster layer as a comparative for Twitter activity, given the logic that represents a 
												basic relationship between more people and more tweets. Further, considering the level-3 data targets 
												mainly the town scale, parallels can be drawn between a town area and population dens areas. For the 
												purposes of reflecting the main trends, this is useful, however a more detailed breakdown could have 
												equally looked into Twitter demographics, and used a raster layer that better reflects this, such as 
												average user age and where these age groups reside. 
											</p>
											<p>
												Importantly, however, producing such a map involves a user input, and decision, upon the 
												significance of both the weighted surface used to decipher the likelihood of where the new 
												location would be, and the spatial ambiguity of the distribution drawn around the new location’s 
												coordinates. Huck et al (2015, pg. 58) attests that “as with many GIS algorithms, specific user 
												input variables can rarely be fully justified”. Therefore, whilst the values used were chosen 
												based upon an exploration of the impact of adjustments to the concerned variables, the map output must be considered in relation to this subjectivity. The weighted raster 
												influence was chosen so not to fully assimilate to the raster pattern – given the data is used 
												for its similar and somewhat comparable but not replicative status – whilst being weighted 
												enough so meaningful patterns at suitable spatial scales are established. Similarly, the degree 
												of spatial ambiguity was chosen to balance between highlighting likely (and of suitable scale 
												given the advertising focus for this data) hotspots for activity, but not to over-compensate for 
												this, producing secondary false hotspots, or elucidating hotspots at too large a scale so that 
												they become somewhat meaningless. As such, the redistributed patterns can be interpreted as producing a 
												meaningful pattern of likely locations of Twitter activity regarding the Royal Wedding, and 
												where advertising should therefore target. This is in terms of both the pattern established, and 
												the geographic accuracy of such patterns, given the use of British National Grid projections 
												that result in low distortions to spatial features. 
											</p>
											<p>
												Indeed, perhaps the most beneficial element of this methodology, is its aim to establish likely 
												patterns rather than individual instances of accuracy. As such, even whilst the data may be 
												inherently messy, and its redistribution, subjective in operation, in general, it reorganizes a 
												somewhat useless dataset, into an array of meaningful patterns, which given the volume of 
												the data, masks many of the smaller scale inaccuracies that arise from the data ambiguities. Indeed, perhaps the most beneficial element of this methodology, is its aim to establish likely

											<h2>Shortest World Border Algorithm</h2>
											<p>An algorithm that finds the shortest shared border between two countries</p>
										</header>
										
										<section>
											<header>
											<h3>Discussion</h3>
										</header>
											<p>
												Fundamentally, the algorithm relies upon an optimisation of a spatial index to improve its 
												efficiency. Primarily, this occurs given each polygon’s bounding box within the ‘world’ 
												GeoDataFrame can be looped through to test for any intersections with neighbouring 
												bounding boxes. Using a spatial index here improves efficiency given the computational 
												ease of comparing rectangles, rather than complex polygons, making the analysis quicker 
												and less expensive. These polygons can then be stored in the ‘possible_matches’, to which 
												the slower, more expensive, analysis occurs, where the actual polygon geometries are 
												checked for intersections (stored in precise_matches). Meaning, the efficiency of the code 
												has been improved, given the computationally costly analysis only occurs for a select few 
												countries that have the possibility of sharing a border, rather than for every polygon in the 
												GeoDataFrame. Following this, the algorithm also restricts any costly calculations of the 
												border length, to only those that share a border, given the currently polygon in the first loop, 
												is compared only with countries that intersect with it (held within ‘precise_matches’). 

											</p>
											<p>
												Importantly, however, as the same GeoDataFrame is looped through twice, countries that 
												share a border would be analysed twice, with the same country pair occurring the opposite 
												way round; once as the bordering country to country_a, and a second time as country_a, 
												which border the country which was formerly country_a, earlier in the loop. Given this, the 
												conditional statement ‘id_2 > id_1’ inputted provides a computational order to the loop, using 
												the ‘id’ of the polygons, to therefore half the number of calculations made by ensuring there 
												were no duplicate border calculations made. Whilst a dictionary could have been used to 
												store polygon pairs that share a border, and the dictionary then looped through to find the 
												shortest border length, this is considered less efficient. This is as extra computational power, 
												and hence time, would be taken up in constructing the dictionary, and populating it, where as 
												the code used utilises the pre-existing ‘id’ characteristic, to achieve the same goal. 
											</p>
											<p>
												Also important to note, is that for this assessment an international border was defined as “a 
												shared boundary between two countries that can be crossed from one country to another”. As 
												such, the algorithm needed to exclude ‘Points’ at which two countries intersect, hence 
												considering ‘MultiLineString’ and ‘LineString’ borders. This is as, within the programming and 
												GIS sphere, a point is considered as infinitely precise and small, meaning within this context, 
												the points have no geometry, and therefore, neither can they be crossed. As such, where 
												countries may be considered to share a border in other contexts, for this project they were 
												excluded from analysis. It too, is important here to note that these ‘borders’, are defined by 
												the polygons held within the GeoDataFrame, and as such the polygon complexity and 
												accuracy is inherently entangled in the data held within the GeoDataFrame, that informs 
												polygon characteristics, and therefore where (and if) the polygons intersect, and their degree 
												of intersection. This broadens the discussion to include more widely the struggles associated 
												with mapping the real world within python, and also the problems it encounters with borders 
												as superimposed geo-political constructs, rather than identifiable and uniformly defined 
												phenomena. 
											</p>
											<p>
												This project represented the earth using the WGS84 global model; a model commonly taken 
												as standard for work at the global scale, which enables the relatively accurate measuring of 
												the distances of borders using geodesic computations. Following this, the Eckert IV projection 
												was used, that is also commonly used as a reliable and relatively accurate projection, as can 
												be shown by the distortion calculations for this project: 
											</p><br>
											
												     <ul><ul><ul>Distance distortion (Ep): 0.008363 <br>
												     Shape distortion (Es): 0.019536 <br>
												     Area distortion (Ea): 0.000297 <br>
												     Scale factor (Ka): 1.000594</ul></ul></ul>
											
											<p>
												In this sense, the map can be seen to be both orthopanic, through the area and scale 
												preservation which produces the countries (polygons) as they would expect to be seen, in 
												terms of shape and size. Equally, the calculations for border length can be deemed very 
												reliable, given such low distance distortion figures. This could have been improved further by 
												using a more localised map projection yet using such a map projection would mean the 
												algorithm didn’t work autonomously, given the result countries and border would need to be 
												pre-emptively known, or require user-input. 
											</p>
											<p>
												However, as with any map creation, this project was limited by the data inputted. Primarily, as 
												would be expected with such a large data set, the data has a low resolution and as such is 
												greatly generalised. Meaning, with lower polygon complexity and detail, the border lengths 
												and results are all relative to the level of detail and complexity within the GeoDataFrame. 
												Equally, this too recognises that the results are true only for this GeoDataFrame, and with 
												other inputs, could produce different results. Indeed, the solution itself presented a further 
												problem, in that with the spatial reach of the two countries that form the final border being so 
												different, producing a map output that provided context for the larger country, whilst still 
												making the border visible and centred wasn’t feasible. Meaning, the final map output, whilst it 
												details the countries in the legend, there is little visually, for the map interpreter to have a clear 
												understanding of where country_a and country_b truly are in relation to one another.
